Subject: Methodology to provide the coal block allottee PSUs of
Power Sector with some flexibility in utilization of coal extracted
from the coal mines allotted under the Coal Mines (Special
Provisions) Act, 2015 for optimum utilization of coal mine for the
same end uses in the public interest and to achieve cost efficiencies
The undersigned is directed to refer to the subject mentioned above
and to say that an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) has been
constituted under the chairmanship of Additional Secretary (Coal) to
devise methodology to provide the coal block allottee PSUs with some
flexibility in utilization of coal extracted from the coal mines allotted
under the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 {CM(SP) Act, 2015}
for optimum utilization of coal mine for the same end uses in the public
interest and to achieve cost efficiencies. The 1st meeting of IMC was
held on 07.08.2017 at 3:00 PM in the conference room of Ministry of
Coal. IMC recommended that to start with, methodology for
arrangement between two allottee PSUs which have been allotted coal
mines under the provisions of CM(SP) Act, 2015 would be considered.
2. In view of the methodology deliberated by IMC in its first meeting
and comments of Ministry of Power received vide No. FU-17/2017-IPC
dated 30.08.2017 thereon, the following methodology has been
approved by this Ministry:
a. The arrangement (s) / agreements (s) shall be in accordance with
Section 20 (1) of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 read
with Rules 19 of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Rules, 2014.
b. The present methodology has been formulated for arrangement (s)/
agreements (s) that may be entered between a PSU (hereinafter
referred to as "the PSU") which has been allotted coal mine(s) under
the provisions of CM (SP) Act, 2015 on the one hand and "other PSU"
which has either been allotted coal mine (s) or granted coal linkage (s)
for same end uses on the other. The scope of such
arrangement/agreement may include transfer of coal by the PSU to
other PSU in lieu of coal or power generated from such coal.
c. Arrangement for optimum utilization of coal mine with a company
which is not a successful bidder or allottee or has not been granted
coal linkage(s) is not allowed as such an arrangement is not
permissible as per the CM(SP) Act, 2015.
d. The agreement(s)/arrangement(s) as provided in the Section 20(1)
of the CM (SP) Act, 2015 should be for optimum utilization of the coal â€¢
mine, for the same end uses, in the public interest and to achieve cost
efficiencies. The overall objective should be to reduce the cost of
power.
e. To achieve transparency, the particulars mentioned in Rule 19(2) of
CMSP Rules, 2014 should be displayed on the website of PSU allottee.
f. Before making an application to the Ministry of Coal, both the parties
to the arrangement should categorically certify the following regarding
the proposed arrangements:
i. Such arrangement results in optimum utilisation of coal mine.
ii. Such arrangement achieves cost efficiencies.
iii. Such arrangement is in public interest.
g. The application for the proposed arrangement (s)/ agreement (s)
shall contain full justification, calculations and the basis of arriving at
the conclusions in above para. The relevant calculations showing the
reduction in cost of power before and after the proposed agreement
(s)/ arrangement (s) should also be enclosed. The proposal so received
would be examined by a Technical Committee (TC) that may be
constituted or a Transaction Advisor (TA) that may be appointed for the
purpose. The report containing recommendations of TC/TA shall be sent
to MoP for comments. Upon receiving the comments/recommendation
from MoP, MoC shall take a decision on the proposed arrangement (s)/
agreement (s).
h. The parties would be required to furnish such additional information
as may be required.
i. Since the arrangement (s)/ agreement (s) under Section 20(1) are to
be in public interest, these should result in reduction in cost of power.
j. CERC/SERC while determining tariff, shall ensure that the benefits of
such arrangements are passed on to the consumers.
k. In case of coal being transferred in lieu of power generated from
such coal,
i. all the power generated from the transferred coal under the
arrangement(s)/agreement (s) shall be supplied to "the PSU" or its
beneficiary Discom(s) as the first right of "the PSU " provided that
any power not requisitioned by the PSU or its beneficiary Discom(s
) shall be treated as per the provisions of the Tariff Policy notified
by Ministry of Power under section 3 of the Electricity Act,
2003 or as may be notified by Ministry of Power.
ii. The landed cost of power generated and delivered to the "the
PSU" (or its beneficiary Discom) transferring coal shall include
corresponding fixed charges, variable charges and transmission
charges at the periphery of the beneficiary Discom of "the PSU"
transferring coal and should be cheaper than the variable charge
for generation from the existing options of using coal in plant(s)
owned by "the PSU". This condition would be applicable where the
coal proposed to be transferred is being utilized in an existing
plant by "the PSU" transferring coal and such transfer of coal
would result into backing down the generation from that plant.
The condition may not be insisted upon where the PSU transfers
the coal which is more than normative requirement of linked EUPs.
I. Except in accordance with the arrangement/agreement approved
under this policy or in accordance with the respective allotment
agreement /CMDPA, no trading or sale of coal shall be allowed since
coal mines have been allotted for specified end use.
m. Monitoring of the agreement(s)/arrangement(s) with regard to coal
production would be done by CCO, with regard to power generated
and delivered would be done by CEA, and with regard to tariffs by
concerned regulators.
n. The arrangements should be worked out in consultation with the
Railways, if it involves transport of coal by rail mode.
o. An inter-ministerial sub-group consisting of representatives from
Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Railways, CEA and
POSOCO would be constituted to look into various operational issues
arising during implementation of this scheme. The sub-group would
meet at least quarterly and the methodology will be reviewed
periodically for amendments, if any, based on the experience gained
during the process.
3. This is issued with the approval of the Competent Authority.

Subject: Methodology for fixing Upfront Payment and Reserve Price
for Allotment of Coal Mines/Blocks for sale of coal to PSUs
under the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015.
The undersigned is directed to refer to Rule 8 (3) of the Coal Mines
(Special Provisions) Rules, 2014 and Section 8 (5) of the Coal Mines (Special
Provisions) Act, 2015 and to say that the Central Government has approved
the methodology for fixing Upfront Payment and Reserve Price for Allotment
of Coal Mines/Blocks for sale of coal to PSUs under the Coal Mines (Special
Provisions) Act, 2015 as mentioned below:-
"Upfront Payment for Allotment: The Intrinsic Value of the coal block will
be calculated by computing its Net Present Value (NPV), based on
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method. The 10 % of this intrinsic value will be
payable upfront in 3 installments of 5%, 2.5% and 2.5% as prescribed in the
allotment document. This is similar to the methodology used for calculation
of upfront payment for coal mines/blocks allotted to the Government
Companies for specified end-uses.
Reserve Price for allotment: A reserve price equivalent to the amount of
the royalty on coal as per prevalent rate shall be payable on per tonne basis
to the relevant coal bearing State Government as per actual production of
coal by the successful allottee including the allottees in the State of West
Bengal where royalty is prescribed in Rs. per tonne. The amount will be
calculated as per the extant / prevailing rate of royalty ad-valorem on price
of coal as reflected in the invoice, excluding taxes, levies and other charges.
The statutory royalty and other levies payable on coal will continue to be
governed as per extant rules."

Subject:- Methodology for IlXing Floor/Reserve Price for Auction and
Allotment of Coal Mines/Blocks.
In accordance with the provisions of Rule 8(3) of the Coal Mines
(Special Provisions), Rules, 2014 and Section 8(5) of the Coal Mines (Special
Provisions), Ordinance, 2014 the Government is pleased to approve the
Methodology for fixing Floor/ReserVe Price for Auction and Allotment of. Coal
Mines/Blocks as mentioned below:-
ME-THODOLOGY FOR FIXING FLOOR/RESERVE PRICE
1. For IlXing floor price for Auction for sectors like Steel, Sponge iron,
Cement, Captive Power etc.:
The Intrinsic Value of the coal block will be calculated by computing its
Net Present Value (NPV), based on Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method. The
10 % of this intrinsic value will be payable u pfront in 3 installments of 5%,
2.5% and 2.5% as prescribed in the bidding document. The final NPV (after
subtracting the upfront payment received from the bidder) will then be
annuitized to become equal to a unit ratio in terms of Rs/tonne (viz. floor
price). In this case for calculation of intrinsic value, it is proposed that, the
extant notified price of CIL (price of domestic coal) for the non-regulated
sectors for the corresponding GCV bands will be taken into account for
computing NPV. However, floor price shall not be less than Rs. ISO/-per
to=e. The resultant bid price (Rs/to=e) shall be considered as base for the
year of bidding with yearly escalation linked to the WPI. The statutory royalty
payable on coal will continue to be governed as per extant rules.
2. For IlXing Reserve Price for coal mines /blocks to be allotted for
power projects to be set up in future on tariff based bidding (Case-2) and
3. For IlXing Reserve Price for coal mines/blocks to be allotted to the
Government Companies for specified end-uses:
A fixed Reserve Price of Rs.l 00 / - per tonne of coal shall be payable, as
per actual production by the successful allottee. The statutory royalty payable
on coal. will continue to be governed as per extant rules. This would ensure
that there is no adverse impact on power tariff. The successful allottee shall
have to pay upfront payment, as mai be prescribed in the tender/allotment
document. There is no bidding on coal under these two categories. The
'Reserve Price' may be escalated using a pre-determined formula that is
prescribed in now prevailing Standard Bidding Documents for Case-l bidding
as formulated by Ministry of Power for escalation of fuel cost from captive
mines. However, for existing generation capacity contracted through tariff bid
based PPAs (Case-2), arranging fuel is the responsibility of power procurer.
Such Case-2 projects shall not be eligible to participate in the auction process
for the coal blocks.
4. For Itxing the ceiling price for coal mines/blocks to be auctioned
for generation capacity having cost plus PPAs or for generation capacity
having tariff bid based PPAs (Case-l)/generation capacity tQ be
contracted through cost plus PPAs or through tariff bid based PPAs
(Case-I) in future:
a. A Ceiling Price of ClL Notified price for each coal block will be
fixed and the bidders will be mandated to quote lower than this Ceiling
Price. The Ceiling price shall be fixed at Run-of-Mine (ROM) price of
equivalent grade, as specified by ClL for the power sector. The bidder
quoting the lowest will be the successful bidd~r. This will be taken for
transfer price to the plant from the coal block. The resultant bid price
of coal will be escalable in line with a pre-specilied escalation formula
for the purpose of considering the energy charge. This method will
ensure that the benefit of lower bid price is passed through to the
consumers ..
b. The bid price of coal shall be considered as base for the year of
bidding and it shall be escalable with pre-determined formula that is
prescribed in now prevailing Standard Bidding Document for Case-l
bidding as formulated by MoP, for escalation of fuel cost from captive
mInes.
c. A fixed Reserve Price of Rs.l00 / - per tonne of coal shall be
payable, as per actual production by the successful allocattee. The
statutory royalty payable on coal will continue to be governed as per
extant rules i.e. at the ClL notilied price. Similarly, the reserve price
may also be escalable using the same formula as in 'b' above.
d. The successful allottee shall have to make upfront paYment @ 10
% of the intrinsic value of the coal block in 3 installments of 5%, 2.5%
and 2.5%, as prescribed in the bidding document. 
e., To ensure that, the benefit of coal is passed on to the consumers,
the following conditions has been prescribed:
I. For generation capacity having cost plus PPAs or
generation capacity to be contracted through cost plus PPAs
in future - For the purpose of determining the fuel cost for cost
, plus PPAs, the Appropriate Commission will allow bid price of
coal along with subsequent escalation as provided in coal block
bid document as being equivalent to the Run of Mine (ROM) cost
of coal together with other allowable expenses and levies,
provided that it shall not lead to higher energy charge throughout
the tenure of PPA than that which would have been obtained as
per the terms and conditions of the existing PPA.
II. For the generation capacity contracted through tariff
bid based PPAs (Case-I) - The Appropriate Commission 'shall
review the quoted energy charge keeping in view that the actual
bid price of coal along' with subsequent escalation as provided in
coal block biel document as being equivalent to Run of Mine
(ROM) cost of coal alongwith statutory levies and other
permissible components of energy charge, provided that such
revision shall not lead to higher energy charge throughout the
tenure of PPA than that which would have been obtained as per
the terms and conditions of the existing PPA. For this purpose,
the allocation of coal block under the new provisions shall be
treated as "Change in Law" to enable the Appropriate Commission
to revise the tariff downwards in accordance with the provisions
of PPA.
III. For the generation capacity to be contracted through
tariff bid based PPAs (Case-I) in future - The Appropriate
Commission .shall while adopting the tariff under Section 63 of
the Electricity Act, 2003, ensure that the energy charge is derived
based on the actual bid price of coal along with -subsequent
escalation as provided in coal block bid document as being
equivalent to Run of Mine (ROM) cost of coal alongwith statutory
levies and other permissible components of energy charge.
IV. For this purpose Ministry of Power will make suitable
provisions in the Tariff policy and! or in the bidding
guidelines issued under the Electricity Act, 2003.
f. For power plant having uncontracted capacity, the bidder shall be
mandated to cap its merchant capacity at 15 % of the 
capacity linked to the allotted coal block for sale of power outside
medium and long term PPAs contracted under Section 62 or Section 63
of the Electricity Act, 2003. Further the bidder shall have to pay an
additional reserve price for the quantum of coal used for power sold in
the merchant market. The additional reserve price for coal used for
merchant sale of power shall be based on intrinsic value of the coal
block annuitized over the yearly production in Rs/tonne terms. The
intrinsic value can be arrived at with the existing approved methodology
for steel/sponge iron/cement sectors/captive power. The additional
Reserve Price shall not be less than Rs. 150/- per tonne. Further the
resultant additional reserve price (Rs/tonne) shall be considered as
base for the year of bidding with yearly escalation linked to the WPI.
5. Any further revision of ClL price after the bid due date would not have
any impact on the bid price of the blocks already bid as escalation on that
price has already he been provided for in. para 4.(b) above. For future bidding coal blocks, the chen prevailing CILpnce will be considered for determining ceiling price.
6. For auction/ allotment of coal blocks for the purpose of sale of coal as
provided in Section 4(2) of the Coal Mines (Special Pro'ision) Ordinance,
2014, a separate methodology will be form ulated.
